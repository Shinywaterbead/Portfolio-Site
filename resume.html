    <h4>My Professional Journey</h4>
           </article> 
       <p class="section">In high school, I was torn between two dreams. I wanted to be an English teacher, but I also thought it would be fun to work for 
           the video game company, Working Designs. I loved their excellent translations and spellbinding stories, and I took two years of 
           Japanese to explore becoming a translator and adapter of video games made overseas. I told friends that I wanted to become "the next Ted Woolsey," the translator of Square's Final Fantasy series. However, in the end, the goal of becoming a teacher won, and I headed to Saint Louis University to work on my English and Education degrees.</p>
     <p></p> 
       </p>
       <p class="section">From July 2002-2003, I was a museum attendant at Saint Louis University Museum of Art. There, I provided tours of exhibited artwork, ensuring a friendly and helpful reception for all museum patrons.
         I conducted research on different artists and wrote descriptions for display placards. I was also in charge of maintaining 
         electronic exhibits, since I was the only technically-inclined employee. The museum often hosted fancy events, and during one of them, I met my future manager. We got to talking, and I asked if he needed any help at his law firm. He said he did, gave me his card, and within a week, I became an administrative assistant at Fox & Vuylsteke, LLP. </p>
         <p class="section">From January 2003 through January 2005, I acted as the face of the firm by answering phones, greeting clients, and hand-delivering messages to other law firms in the downtown Saint Louis area. I convinced my boss and his partner to allow me to begin the transfer of all of their physical files to digital formats. I enjoyed fixing the copier and solved computer issues for both lawyers, our paralegal, and our office assistant. It was my job to open and close files, and I kept paperwork organized and up-to-date with the incoming mail that I sorted. There was often a lot of downtime, so I was able to work on homework, read, and even play video games on a PS One with a Mobile Monitor on the slowest days! It was a wonderful job, and I was sad to leave--but I had to start my student teaching semester, and it was impossible to do that with even a part-time job.             
         </p>
         <p class="section">Student teaching at Webster Groves High School was the toughest challenge I'd faced so far. Though I loved seeing my students grow, I was not a fan of seemingly endless grading and planning, and I hated having to discipline my kids. Looking back, I wish that I would have realized my discomfort and abandoned my dream, but as a life-long straight-A student who wasn't used to failure, I was determined to press on.</p>
         <p class="section">
         In May 2005, I graduated from Saint Louis University with a double major in English Language and Literature and Secondary Education. From April through June, I worked a brief summer job at Peters Marketing Research as I applied for teaching jobs. It was fun, since my job entailed calling people who had requested to be added to our database, asking questions to see if they qualified for focus group studies, and then offering those who fit our profiles an opportunity to participate in market research studies for cash. Here, I built upon my existing communication skills and gained insight into effective marketing. After a few interviews with different schools, I was offered teaching positions in two schools. I chose the school closer to my parents' house, since I still had student loans to pay off, and entered my first year as a teacher.
         </p>
        <p class="section">In June 2005, I entered the teaching field sooner than I'd expected I would, as the school hired me to teach summer school. I left my job at Peters and headed in to Pacific High School, ready to fulfill my dream. Teaching summer school was exciting and fun, and I was thrilled to begin making a difference. Unfortunately, my teaching career was fraught with far more difficulty and heartache than I expected. The rural school was poor and underfunded, as many schools are, and I was overwhelmed with the number of different classes I had to prepare for each semester. I developed a new curriculum for a Fundamentals of Reading class, which was for students who had failed English three years in a row. I also taught English 10, Communication Today, Drama, and in my second year, Science-Fiction. All of these classes had their merits, but I was having a difficult time staying on top of my workload. I had also spent a lifetime as a model student, and this led to me feeling helpless when it came to disciplining students.  The teacher before me had quit abruptly, and students had a substitute teacher for the better part of a semester before I came to the school. Because of this, many students had heard that the classes I taught were "blow-off" classes, and when they arrived to the new semester, they were shocked that a full-time--not a substitute--teacher expected results. I cherish many memories from those days, but it was a difficult time for lousy pay, and I resigned in May 2007.

             <p class="section">That summer, I enrolled in a ladies' workout class, and met a gal who worked for the AT&T Real Yellow Pages. She said she loved her job, and I decided to apply while I considered my path forward. I was hired as a Telemarketing Administrator to support Yellow Pages sales in August 2007, and I absolutely LOVED my job. I started that summer making over $14,000 more than I had made as a teacher, and by the time I left the job ten years later, I was making over $27,000 more than I had made. The money was fantastic, and I loved my coworkers. I enjoyed the opportunity to help people around me, and I was able to make use of my English degree by proofreading advertising contracts to ensure accuracy and quality. I proofread and edited all outgoing correspondence and internal contract verbiage for multiple teams, and I also handled a number of clerical duties, such as faxing, making copies, emailing, assembling proposals, creating reports, and arranging travel plans. As I gained experience, I found myself training my coworkers on numerous processes. I began to develop tutorials and conduct training sessions for both sales representatives and my fellow clerical staff. In a campaign to document and bolster team spirit, the manager of the call center asked me to conduct interviews of representatives and compose a bi-weekly newsletter of office sales highlights. I loved the opportunity to talk to coworkers about their successes and help them share them with everyone. I also got familiar with Microsoft Office Suite and Salesforce, and ended up being the first recipient of the Yellow Pagesâ€™ Nationwide Sales Support MVP Award in August 2016.                      
            </p>
            <p class="section">During my time at the Yellow Pages, my brother invited him to join him in proofreading remotely for Seven Seas Entertainment, a North American manga publisher. I was thrilled--it was the closest I would get to my high school dream of bringing Japanese culture to America. In June 2013, I began picking up proofreading and eventually adaptation assignments. I still maintain my permalancer employment with Seven Seas, and as of February 2017, I have my name in over 250 edited works! Some of my favorite titles include <em>Made in Abyss, No Game, No Life, Devils and Realist,</em> and <em>Absolute Duo.</em> The job involves drawing clear and conversational English adaptations from roughly-translated Japanese and Korean dialogue, as well as editing copy, proofreading layouts, and inspecting manuscripts for syntactical errors. You can see a partial listing of my edited works <a href="https://goo.gl.1RE8xb">here!</a>

            <p class="section">In January 2014, our office moved from Olivette to Maryland Heights, and I decided I needed to find a job that was closer to my South Saint Louis home. After many interviews, I joined my sweetheart Jeremy, who was working as a software engineer at World Wide Technology Asynchrony Labs, as Asynchrony's newest Contract Administrator. In my current position, I support the Statement of Work (SOW) process, including due diligence reviews to ensure compliance in execution. I examine each SOW to uncover potential risks, and make sure we have thought of possible mitigations for those risks. I work closely with legal liaisons, account managers, the SOW Review Team, and delivery leads to ensure proper contractual paperwork is in place to begin work on various projects. I keep things organized by coordinating through Trello, SalesForce, and SharePoint. I manage, review, and approve change orders for various projects, and maintain a repository of contractual documents.I also facilitate project initiation meetings between stakeholders to ensure projects are set up for success, ensuring our delivery teamsâ€™ and customersâ€™ questions are answered. As in my last job, I  often develop tutorials and conduct training sessions for account managers and back-office staff on various functions. 
            </p>
            <p class="section">I love the work I do at World Wide Technology, and I'm working to expand my skills--I'm learning the art of Retro Facilitation, and I'm exploring the idea of pursuing a career as an Agile Coach. I find our developers' work fascinating, and I hope that, through CoderGirl, I'll gain a greater understanding of the cool tech we produce. I'd love to join our delivery teams in the future as a developer--or maybe even learn to craft video games! Working Designs ceased operations in 2005, but maybe some day I'll play a part in creating amazing video games that will inspire young nerds everywhere! </p>
